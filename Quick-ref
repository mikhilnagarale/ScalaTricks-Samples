Function Literals-
https://alvinalexander.com/scala/how-to-use-functional-literals-anonymous-functions-in-scala

Tips:-

-> used for defining key,value pair while defining dictionary in scala (Key -> Value)
<- to pass a value or sequence to a variable inside a for loop
=> function literal/anonymus function map,filter all functions will use this
= assignment / define a function

foreach - iterate over the values in sequential fashion does not return anything & operate on data itself
map - iterate over the values in sequential fashion returns a collection of the values returned by the function passed to it.
for - Just a syntax change for foreach function
filter - apply a boolean function/condition on input & rreturns a resultset which satisfies the boolean condition
flatMap -Works same as Map function the only difference is if the result has array or list then it flattens it.
