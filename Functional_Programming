Functional_Programming-
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Functional programming is way of writing software application using only 'pure functions' & 'Immutable Values'.

Elements of FP-
1. Pure Function-
   Function = input -> relationship -> output
   -> Input solely determine the output
   -> Function doesn't change it's input (eg. Call by value/Call by Ref)
   -> Function doesn't do anything except computing output (Side effect like writing to the file , console writing , etc).
   
    
Side Effect- If function does anything else other than computing output like writing to file or console then it's called side effect of the function.
             Doing something other than primary purpose.
             
How to validate purity of function-
Yes- Test for Referencial Transperency

What is referencial transperency?
- A function is referencial Transperent if we can replace it with a corresponding value without changing the program behaviour.


Why Pure Functions-
-> Pure Functions are safef, small, precise, easy to re-use, they don't surprise you
-> Pure functions are more composable
-> Pure functions are easy to test
-> Memoizable
-> Can be lazy


FirstClass Functions-
If you can treat a function as a value, it is a first class function.
i.e you should be able to do everything with a function which you can do with value
eg
->you can assign function to a variable.
->you should be able to pass a function as an argument
->you can able to return a function from function

In Scala all the functions are FirstClass Function

Higher Order Function-
A higher order function is a function which either takes one or more function as an argument or returns a function as an result.

Syntax for Function-
def myFunc(x:Int) = {x*2} //regular function

Anonymus Function-
A function without name is anonymus function.
Syntax -
(x:Int) => {x*2} //anonymus function
{x*2} //anonymus function. This is actuall only the function body. Scala will identify the parameter type & convert this body to function internally.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Immutability-
Unable to change

var- variable - can change it
val- value - can't ch

Benifits of immutability-
1) It helps us adopt mathemetical approach
2) It helps us to avoid various problems - Immutable objects are more thread safe. 
                                           Immutability allows a thread to work on object without worrying about other threads since it knows that no one is modifying the object.
                                           Immutability is important in multithreaded environment.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recursion & Tail Recursion-

Ref-https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tail-recursion/

Recursion- Function call's itself
Tail Recursion- Arecursive function is a tail recursive when the recursive call is the last thing executed by the function.

Why do we care about Tail Recursion-
Tail recursive functions are better than recursive function since compiler can optimize them. Since compiler comes to know that recursive call is the last thing to do then there is no point to do anything in current function.
SO it doesn't maintain that memory stack and performs the operations while executing the recursion.
Benifits- 1) No stack maintain in memory hense it's memory efficient operation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Statements-
A statement is the smallest standalone element that expresses some action to be carried out.

eg: println("Hello World!")

In Function Paradym - In Function programming every statement have capability to return the value.

Void vs Unit-
Void in java means nothing.
Unit in scala can be use as a void but it's a value in Scala.

Expression in Scala- Since Scala statement returns value it's sometimes called expression and 
                     you can 100% say that Scala  doesn't have statement but only expression.
                     
Benifits of statement returning a value?
-It helps to achive immutability.
How?- Since every statement reurns a value then -> you don't need to use variables to capture the outcoe of the statements.
       -> Now since you don't need to use variables so no need to change the state of variables 
       so -> It indirectly encourages the immutability.
       

Eg-
Imperative Style                                         |                           Functional Style
                                                         |
def myResult(i:Int):Unit = {                             |                     def myResult(i:Int):String = {
res=""                                                   |                     if (i>=0) {"Passed"}
if (i>=50) {r="Passed"}                                  |                     else {"fail"}
else {r="fail"}                                          |                     }
println(r)                                               |
}                                                        |


As per above example functional version of code is 
-> concise
-> and returning statement helps us to reduce variables
-> and achive immutability.

Strict & Lazy Evaluation-
Strict Evaluation- Evaluate expression now.
Lazy Evaluation- Evaluate expression on first use.


observations-
1) Default method of expression evaluation in Scala is strict
2) Scala evaluates function parameters before passing the value to the function. Hense parameters are evaluated only once.
3) If the parameters to the functionare function (Higher order functions) instead of premitive type then scala will evaluate the function when it's actually called or on every use of the function.
4) If you don't want multiple evaluation of a function then you can cache it using val.

Lazy Evaluation-
Scala evaluate lazy values on it's first use.

You can make an expression by using a lazy val.
There is no syntax to make a function lazy. However you can make a function lazy by caching it to a lazy val.

WHy Lazy?-
val s  = Source.fromFile("/home/ubuntu/myLogFile.txt").getLines().toList.filter(x => x.contains("Error")).take(1)
val s  = Source.fromFile("/home/ubuntu/myLogFile.txt").getLines().toList.filter(_.contains("Error")).take(1)
val s  = Source.fromFile("/home/ubuntu/myLogFile.txt").getLines().toList.filter(_.contains("Error")).take(2)

Lazy Evaluation using Stream instead of List-


scala> val s  = Source.fromFile("/home/ubuntu/myLogFile.txt").getLines().toStream
s: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[String] = Stream(Hi , ?) //Since we used toStream it only readed a first line in file.

scala> val s  = Source.fromFile("/home/ubuntu/myLogFile.txt").getLines().toStream.filter(_.contains("Error"))
s: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[String] = Stream(Error heloo helo hi bye, ?) 
// Here We applied the filter for value "Error". The file has two rows with value "Error" but it didn't applied the filter on whole file.
// and instead it gave us the single value yet. It's kind of partial evaluation which saves memory.

scala> val s  = Source.fromFile("/home/ubuntu/myLogFile.txt").getLines().toStream.filter(_.contains("Error")).take(2)
s: scala.collection.immutable.Stream[String] = Stream(Error heloo helo hi bye, ?)
// Here now even after mentioning that '.take(2)' means pick 2 values with "Error" . It's still taking only 1 row. This is because we've not yet 
// used the value of s . So it's sitill partial evaluation .

scala> println(s)
Stream(Error heloo helo hi bye, ?)
//Here as well it's printing only one row instead of two. SInce Scala knew that printing the row is just not use of value it's just for validation.

scala> s foreach println
Error heloo helo hi bye
Error HI Hello bye hi bye

// Finally it executed and we got two rows. This is because we used the value of s to loop and then print. 
// So it's actually like we required the second or all the rows in value s.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example of stream (Stream is a Lazy list in Scala)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
def fibForm(a:Int,b:Int): Stream[Int] ={ a #:: fibForm(b,a+b)}
// Stream[Int] - Our function is returning a Stream of int values.
// #:: - This sign is use to append to the Stream

scala> val x = fibForm(1,2)
x: Stream[Int] = Stream(1, ?)
//It's a lazy evaluation since we used Stream
