Functional_Programming-
Functional programming is way of writing software application using only 'pure functions' & 'Immutable Values'.

Elements of FP-
1. Pure Function-
   Function = input -> relationship -> output
   -> Input solely determine the output
   -> Function doesn't change it's input (eg. Call by value/Call by Ref)
   -> Function doesn't do anything except computing output (Side effect like writing to the file , console writing , etc).
   
    
Side Effect- If function does anything else other than computing output like writing to file or console then it's called side effect of the function.
